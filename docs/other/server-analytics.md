# Server Analytics

If you wish to add server analytics to track down bandwidth usage and server hardware usage, you can use Netdata on your server. You can read more about Netdata on their [Website](https://www.netdata.cloud).

Here's how you can install it: [https://github.com/netdata/netdata?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started](https://github.com/netdata/netdata?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started)\
Visit this page and follow an install guide for your machine.

Once this is done, visit your server on the port **19999** like localhost:19999 and configure it from there. Everything should work fine with almost no configuration!

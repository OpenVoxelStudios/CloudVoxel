# ‚òÅÔ∏è CloudVoxel - Welcome!

## CloudVoxel?

### What is CloudVoxel?

CloudVoxel is a robust file-sharing platform that puts you in control:

* üì§ **Unlimited Uploads**: No arbitrary file size restrictions
* üîó **File Sharing**: Share files with others, even if they are not logged in
* üîí **Access Control**: User whitelisting by their email address
* üí° **Open Source**: Community-driven development and transparency

{% endhint %}

### Why CloudVoxel?

CloudVoxel is born with the idea of a simple open-source file hosting and sharing platform to deploy in your local network or on a VPS. [Kubik](https://github.com/KodeurKubik) (the repository maintainer) initially created this for [OpenVoxel Studios](https://openvoxel.studio) for an intern file sharing service, but it turned out to be better to just open-source the whole code!

## Let's get starting!

### Downloading your instance

CloudVoxel will run where ever you want. On a raspberry pi or on a VPS it should work out of the box!

{% hint style="info" %}
Check out the [installation.md](server-management/installation.md "mention") guide to proceed with the installation!
{% endhint %}

### Configuring your instance

Configurng CloudVoxel has to be done the first time before running your instance. There are a few files that have to be changed but then, you're ready to go!

{% hint style="info" %}
Visit the [configuration.md](server-management/configuration.md "mention") guide to learn how to configure your instance!
{% endhint %}

### Running your instance

Now that everything is ready, you can start running your instance! You can either run a development server first to test everything or directly run the production server.

But more about that on the [starting-the-server.md](server-management/starting-the-server.md "mention") page where you will learn how to start your server!

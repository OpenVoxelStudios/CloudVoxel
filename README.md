## Installation

First, clone the repository and prepare the configuration files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVoxelStudios/CloudVoxel/
cd CloudVoxel
cp .env.example .env.production
cp config.example.ts config.ts
```

Then install the dependencies with `bun install`, `npm install` or any other node package manager.

Now, there are 3 config files, so go ahead and edit them!
```yaml
- clientconfig.ts: All the configuration that will be used client side
- config.ts: The server side configuration
- .env.production: All the credentials and keys
```

Now that you have your config, you can init the database with one of these commands:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate && npx drizzle-kit migrate
# or
bunx drizzle-kit generate && bunx drizzle-kit migrate
```

**You are now ready to run CloudVoxel!**

In dev mode:
```bash
npx next dev
```

Or in production mode:
```bash
# only run build once after each edit
npx next build
npx next start
```

NOTE: NextJS does not use https. If you want to open it to the internet in https (highly recommended), you can use software like NGINX to serve as a "proxy".

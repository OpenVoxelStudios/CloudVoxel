## Installation

First, clone the repository and prepare the configuration files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenVoxelStudios/CloudVoxel/
cd CloudVoxel
cp .env.example .env.production
cp config.example.ts config.ts
```

Then install the dependencies with `bun install`, `npm install` or any other node package manager.

Now, there are 3 config files, so go ahead and edit them!
```yaml
- clientconfig.ts: All the configuration that will be used client side
- config.ts: The server side configuration
- .env.production: All the credentials and keys
- .env.development: (optional) You can also setup this file to use it when running in dev mode
```

Now that you have your config, you can init the database with one of these commands:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit generate && npx drizzle-kit migrate
# or
bunx drizzle-kit generate && bunx drizzle-kit migrate
```

**You are now ready to run CloudVoxel!**

In dev mode:
```bash
npx next dev
```

Or in production mode:
```bash
# only run build once after each edit
npx next build
npx next start
```

NOTE: NextJS does not use https. If you want to open it to the internet in https (highly recommended), you can use software like NGINX to serve as a "proxy".

## Documentation

> There's no dedicated page yet!

You can manage users, manage API keys and sync the local storage with the database with the new CLI introduced in v1.1!
```bash
bun cli.ts
# it seems like "deno" does not work with the cli...
```

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to CloudVoxel you can freely do so!

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide before doing so.

### Bug reports / Vulnerability reports

If you find bugs, please let us know! You can create a bug report in the [issues tab](https://github.com/OpenVoxelStudios/CloudVoxel/issues) of the repository.

For security related reports, please check [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md).

## Branch system

From now on, the `main` branch will only be updated from the code on the `dev` branch on every release. So cloning the `main` branch and `git pull`ing will update to the next version.

A branch will be created for specific features that will take more than a commit to complete. They will be merged to `dev` when they are completed. **The `dev` branch is not stable and is not recommended for production!**

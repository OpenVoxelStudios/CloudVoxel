## Branch system

From now on, the `main` branch will only be updated from the code on the `dev` branch on every release. So cloning the `main` branch and `git pull`ing will update to the next version.

A branch will be created for specific features that will take more than a commit to complete. They will be merged to `dev` when they are completed. **The `dev` branch is not stable and is not recommended for production!**
